COVID-19 Vaccine Efficacy Update — 2024

The World Health Organization (WHO) released updated data on COVID-19 vaccine efficacy across multiple regions. According to the report published in January 2024, mRNA-based vaccines demonstrated 89.3% efficacy against severe illness in adults aged 18–65. The study, conducted across 42 countries, involved approximately 2.4 million participants over a 12-month observation period.

Dr. Maria Chen, the lead epidemiologist at the CDC's Division of Viral Diseases in Atlanta, noted that booster doses improved protection by an additional 15% in individuals over 65 years old. However, efficacy against the JN.1 subvariant dropped to 62.7%, raising concerns among public health officials.

Pfizer and Moderna reported that updated bivalent formulations targeting XBB.1.5 and JN.1 showed a 78% reduction in hospitalization rates during the winter surge. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved these formulations in December 2023.

Side effects remained consistent with prior observations: 34% of recipients experienced mild fatigue, 21% reported injection-site soreness, and less than 0.5% experienced serious adverse events. The WHO emphasized that the benefits of vaccination continue to outweigh risks, particularly for immunocompromised populations and individuals over 60.

Health authorities in the United States, United Kingdom, and Japan have recommended annual COVID-19 boosters, similar to influenza vaccination schedules. Funding for global vaccine distribution through COVAX reached $4.2 billion in 2024, a 12% increase from the previous year.
