New Breakthrough in Type 2 Diabetes Management

Researchers at Johns Hopkins University published findings in The Lancet showing that a combination therapy of semaglutide and metformin reduced HbA1c levels by an average of 2.1% over 24 weeks. The randomized controlled trial enrolled 1,850 patients across 15 clinical sites in North America and Europe.

Professor David Harrington, lead author of the study, stated that 73% of participants achieved target HbA1c levels below 7%, compared to 41% in the metformin-only control group. The combination therapy also led to a mean weight reduction of 6.8 kg, which researchers attributed to semaglutide's appetite-suppressing mechanism.

Novo Nordisk, the manufacturer of semaglutide (brand name Ozempic), funded 60% of the trial, while the National Institutes of Health (NIH) provided the remaining support. The FDA is expected to review the combination protocol by Q3 2024.

Adverse events included gastrointestinal issues in 28% of participants, with 4.2% discontinuing treatment due to nausea. Serious adverse events were reported in 1.3% of cases, primarily pancreatitis (0.4%) and gallbladder-related complications (0.9%).

The American Diabetes Association (ADA) highlighted the significance of these findings, noting that early combination therapy could prevent progression to insulin dependence in an estimated 35% of newly diagnosed Type 2 diabetes patients. Global diabetes prevalence currently stands at 537 million adults, with projections reaching 783 million by 2045 according to the International Diabetes Federation.
